## Introduction
This project analyzes the performance of a bike store by leveraging pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib for creating visualizations. The goal is to gain insights into product sales, inventory levels, and customer behavior to improve the store’s business strategies.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy)**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **sqlite3**: To interact with the SQLite database used to store the data.
- **ydata_profiling**: For generating detailed data profiling reports.

## Key Features
- **Order and Sales Analysis**: Exploring order patterns, sales volume, and time-based trends.
- **Inventory Management**: Evaluating stock levels across different stores to ensure product availability.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyzing customer data to improve marketing strategies and customer service.

## Data Description
The project utilizes the following datasets:
- **brands.csv**: Contains information about bike brands.
- **categories.csv**: Contains details about various bike categories.
- **customers.csv**: Includes customer information such as name, contact details, and demographics.
- **order_items.csv**: Contains data about the items included in customer orders.
- **orders.csv**: Details the orders, including order dates and payment information.
- **products.csv**: Contains information about the products (bikes) sold in the store.
- **staffs.csv**: Data on the store staff members.
- **stocks.csv**: Information about stock levels at different stores.
- **stores.csv**: Contains information about the store locations.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Load data from CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and clean categorical data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use pandas and matplotlib to explore key metrics like sales trends, customer demographics, and inventory levels.
4. **Visualizations**: Create visual representations of sales trends, customer insights, and product performance.

## Data Analysis
The analysis is performed within the Jupyter Notebook, which includes:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing and incorrect data, adjusting data types, and outlier removal.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and visual exploration of data trends.
- **Visualizations**: Plotting sales trends, inventory distribution, and customer segments using matplotlib.

## Results & Insights
- **Top Sales**: Certain products and brands consistently generate higher sales.
- **Inventory Issues**: Some stores face frequent stock shortages.
- **Customer Performance**: A specific group of customers contributes to a significant portion of the sales.

## Future Work
- **Sales Prediction**: Develop models to predict future demand and optimize inventory.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Perform deeper analysis into specific product categories.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create real-time dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
